# Hot dog or Not hot dog realtime badass classifier

## Process and notes (for myself)

### Dec 22
The model will load and classify an image (sometimes wrong)

**Cutting corners:**
- Paths solution is horrendous hardcoding
- Project structure can be improved


**To do:**
- Start setting up the realtime project skeleton and __if__ statement my way out of 1000 predictions.
