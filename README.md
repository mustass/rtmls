# Real-Time Visual and Machine Learning Systems

This repository can be private, opposite to being a fork of the course material. And it is lighter to work with. It is intended to include all the work and handins through the course. 


## The project 
The hot-dog / not-hot-dog app is in the `app` directory.

To do:

- [ ] Make the model predict correctly after some training. Just debug the training and make sure it works
- [ ] Split two copies of the model to threads and communicate rather than run on one thread?
- [ ] Make the images downloaded from somewhere and not be hardcoded
- [ ] Make the model path not absolute somehow


## Architecture overview assignment 

- The overview of the architecture and essays on JAX (2pt) and Model Distributed Parallelism (1pt) are [here](https://github.com/mustass/rtmls/blob/main/architecture_analysis_handin/handin.md).

## GPU handin 
The code is [here](https://github.com/mustass/rtmls/tree/main/gpu_hand_in/src) and the associated text (just some learnings and ansers to the questions posed in the assignment) are [here](https://github.com/mustass/rtmls/blob/main/gpu_hand_in/src/handin.md).
